Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass is a driving school that wanted to create a web-based system which allows students to take tests, track their progress and schedule in-person driving appointments. The system is to be used also by staff in the company and drivers, to create student's profiles, reset passwords, and create, change and delete appointments.

What did you do particularly well?

I think I did particularly well when identifying the system's functional requirements.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would improve the System Design Document by being more specific in details such as: selecting a language to develop the project, explaining the needs for a databe and which databes type would be used, as well as explaining security features.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

In order to understand the user's needs I read the interview transcript thouroughly and note down the functional and non-functional aspects the client was expecting to have in the system. If the user was broad in their explanations, then I would research and implement the solution that was most closely related with their goals.


How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When designing software I try to understand what the client expects the system to do, create a list of the critical functions, and create the system design document. I like to create a UML Class Diagram after that, to make a first drawing on how the objects in the system will interact with each other and have a foundation of the attributes that will be on each object.
